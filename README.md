# Toy C compiler - WIP

The goal of this project is not to write a complete C compiler. The goal is to learn ARM architecture and ARM assembly. I will not be writing compiler optimizations etc. This is jus a tool for learning.

I've been using [Writing a C compiler series](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html) by Nora Sandler to implement this, which uses x86 assembly. I'm converting that to ARM64 assembly along the way.

## Build and run

```sh
cargo run -- <file-path>
```
